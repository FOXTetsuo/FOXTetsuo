### Welcome to the Git page of FOXTetsuo. 
... But please, call me Thomas. It's what everyone calls me.
I have a website. It's awful at the moment, but I assure you it's still much more enjoyable than a text file: [fomks.nl](http://fomks.nl)
<br/><br/>
I'm currently a student at Hogeschool windesheim. Here is a list of things I've done in order from least to most impressive:
- Made very basic websites with CSS, HTML & PHP (Semester 1)
- Regretted ever taking robotics (Semester 2)
- Two different .NET applications. (Semester 3)
  - A WPF app that simulates a race between 2-~3000 inklings.
  - A MAUI app where customers can completely customize orders. (KBS Group project)
- A website with cool rotating / flotating leaves (Christmas holidays after semester 3)
- Filled in this readme

If you want to contact me about any of these projects, good luck.
